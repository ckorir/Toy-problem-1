## Two positive numbers

This program takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

## Features

- User can input three numbers
- Check if only exactly two of the three integers are positive
- Returns true if only two of the three integers are positive else false

## Example

```
print(exactly_two_positive(2, 4, -3))   # Output: True
print(exactly_two_positive(-4, 6, 0))   # Output: False
